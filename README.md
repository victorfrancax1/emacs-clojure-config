# This is my Clojure-friendly emacs config
Based on instructions from the book Clojure for The Brave and True.
Also added powerline status bar (https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline).
Using neotree (press f7 key) for dir structure.
## Installing
1. Close Emacs.
2. Delete `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d` if they exist. (Windows users, your
   emacs files will probably live in
   `C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\`. So, for example, you
   would delete `C:\Users\jason\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d`.) This is
   where Emacs looks for configuration files, and deleting these files
   and directories will ensure that you start with a clean slate.
3. Replace it with my files.
4. Then open Emacs.
